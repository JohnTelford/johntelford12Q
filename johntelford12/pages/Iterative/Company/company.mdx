##  Company

---

JohnTelford.com LLC is a  technology consulting company working with client  development projects for the last 30 years. I am the sole proprietor of the company.


Way back when the Internet web browsers and programming languages came along, I became interested in web technologies, and began learn by doing. I have years of learning ever changing Electronics, Internet, and Software technologies by hands-on experiencing the technologies du jour.

I have a passion pursuing what’s new and improved with these industries. Checking out what’s new or not, a pipe dream or not, or what’s new and improved, is like panning for gold. Buried within the mountains of info rubbl
e produced daily, every so often one finds interesting technology nuggets making the effort worthwhile.

I am an Electronics and Software Engineer specializing in web hardware and software technology disciplines:

- Architecture
- Development
- Deployment
