## Deploy

Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.
