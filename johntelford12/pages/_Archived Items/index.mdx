## Overview

Creating websites is difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive.

> Some times companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of errors and security remediations during the life time of the website, may cost a magnitude more money than website development costs.

This website is about optimizing development costs. It descries developing websites using iterative development.

## Perquisites

Knowing  perquisites for building a website are the first steps in optimizing website costs. 

Each Iterative Development process listed below has their perquisites  followed with details

## Iterative Development

### [Define](/Iterative/Define/define)

Defining website results contribute to *Develop*


### [Design](/Iterative/Design/design)

Website *Design* creates the look and feel *Develop* builds 


### [Develop](/Iterative/Develop/develop)

Developing websites is akin to translating *Define* and *Design* into abstract logical structures using rigid nonhuman languages, and a variety of tools. The slightest errors or security issues will require remediations during the life time of the website.


### [Deploy](/Iterative/Deploy/deploy)

Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.


 ### [Maintain](/Iterative/Maintain/maintain)

Maintain is remediating *Define*, *Design*,*Develop*, *Deploy*, or Security problems.



A labyrinth symbolizes possible difficulties reaching web project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines may be helpful.
