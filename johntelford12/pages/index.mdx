## Overview

Creating websites is difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive.

> Some times companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of errors and security remediations during the life time of the website, may cost a magnitude more money than website development costs.

This site is about optimizing website development costs. It descries developing websites using iterative development.

-->

### [Deploy](/Iterative/Deploy/deploy)

Deploying a website is making it available on the Internet. The production version is deployed when stakeholders agree. Meanwhile, developers working on features, fixes, or testing may deploy private website with their changes, without disturbing other developers work or the production version. This enables the stakeholders to monitor progress.

<!--

- Deploy
	- Production version
	- Private development stages deployments
	- Vendor
-->

 ### [Maintain](/Iterative/Maintain/maintain)
